## Market Insights

For the MVP, we will focus on launching the app in the Netherlands, where market research shows that the unpredictability of the weather is a factor people always have to deal with, but unlike other competitors, there are no solutions tackling the ease of activity planning and management, only traditional weather forecasts and alarms.

Our research shows that people in the Netherlands would likely be interested in an app that helps find the best days for outdoor activities and social meetings based on weather, with planning features. This interest aligns with broader European trends showing growing demand for personalized, hyperlocal weather information integrated with lifestyle and activity planning. [1]

### Competitor Analysis

**General Note**
Our app has no direct competitors, we plan to exploit a niche in the market that is currently left unattended by similar apps:
The weather apps are the closest to our niche, they are currently the main source of information users have when planning outdoor activities, and could potentially "copy" our product to expand their offer and retain users. We believe we will draw directly from their users/market and therefore we decided that basing our market analysis on this area would be the most accurate move.

Other potential competitors could be messaging apps and calendar apps, though they are usually part of larger enterprises, and we do not see their product trajectory realistically crossing our niche.

Another potential competitor apps could be those focusing on trails for outdoor sports such as cycling or hiking (eg. Komoot). This could be a realistic trajectory for their product, but since their niche is sports, we believe we won't be directly competing with them - at least during our initial launch.

**Weather App Market in the Netherlands**
The weather app landscape in the Netherlands is dominated by several strong local players alongside some international apps, reflecting a mature and competitive market.

Top local weather apps in the Netherlands by usage and store ranking include:
- **Buienradar - weer** (Publisher: RTL Nederland B.V.) - Top grossing and most used weather app in the Netherlands, consistently holding #1 position.
- **Buienalarm: Weer & Regenradar** (Publisher: Infoplaza Network B.V.) - Strong local presence, ranked #2 in usage and store ranking.
- **Weeronline** (Publisher: Infoplaza Network B.V.) - Another major local player.
- **Weerplaza - complete weer app** (Publisher: Infoplaza Network B.V.) - Ranked within top 10, showing strong local footprint.
- **KNMI** (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut) - Publisher: KNMI is the official Dutch meteorological institute app, ranked #4 in usage.

Other notable local apps include Drops - The Rain Alarm and Weer & Zo, both published by Dutch companies and maintaining solid rankings [6][8].

**International Competitors Present in the Market**
Generally rank lower than local apps:
- AccuWeather (#12 store rank, #18 usage rank)
- The Weather Channel (#24 store rank)
- Windy.com (#5 store rank, #11 usage rank)
- Weather & Radar (WetterOnline GmbH, Germany; #6 store rank, #5 usage rank)

**Market Characteristics**
- The Dutch market favors apps offering hyperlocal, real-time precipitation data, which explains the dominance of Buienradar and Buienalarm.
- Local apps benefit from strong brand recognition and integration with Dutch weather data sources.
- The market is competitive with a mix of free and freemium pricing models, with free apps dominating user adoption [2][6].

### Market Analysis

**Market Demand and User Interest**
- The European weather app market is growing steadily, driven by increased public awareness of weather impacts on daily life and outdoor activities, including recreation and social events [2][3].
- Users increasingly seek apps that provide real-time, accurate, and personalized weather forecasts to optimize their plans, especially for outdoor activities [3][5].
- The Netherlands, with its variable weather and outdoor culture, fits well into this demand for apps that combine weather data with activity planning and social coordination.

**Market Size and Growth Potential**
- The Europe weather app market was valued at approximately EUR 0.80 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow further, supported by regulatory frameworks and technological advances such as AI and IoT integration [2].
- Globally, the weather app market is expected to grow from EUR 2.00 billion in 2025 to EUR 4.2 billion by 2034, with a CAGR of about 7.98%, reflecting strong user adoption and technological innovation [3].
- The Netherlands, as part of the mature European market, benefits from high smartphone penetration and digital literacy, facilitating adoption of sophisticated weather apps [2][4].

### Technology Analysis

All competitors are established in the market and previous to the AI-wave, and have not having noticeably incorporated AI in its UX. Although they might have incorporated ML in their weather forecasting, most of them rely on radar and public data (from the official KNMI API and from other European and international agencies).

### Customer Segments

**Top 3 segments:**
1. **Families with children:** They often spend time outdoors in parks and natural areas, since these are easy and cost-effective family activities. They need simplicity, and backup plans.
2. **Busy Professionals:** They have little time to plan outdoor activities and therefore long for more time outside to allow them to take a breath from their busy lives. When they do plan outdoor activities, they need ease of use in planning and as many automated features as possible to manage them.
3. **Active Outdoor Enthusiasts:** They focus on specific sport activities, with a variety of interests (eg. an ice skating enthusiast is more interested in cold days where ice is naturally formed; a kiteboarding enthusiast needs days with perfect wind conditions; etc). They need specific weather conditions tailored to their sport, which would make our MVP too complex, so we decided to leave this use case for further iterations.

### User Personas

**Top 3 personas:**

**Ineke - Families with Children**
- Age: 30-45
- Interests: Family-friendly outdoor activities, park visits
- Needs: Clear, simple guidance on suitable days to avoid weather disruptions

## The Problem

### Use Cases & Pain Points

We ran a synthetic interview with "Ineke", our main user persona, to uncover potential insights. We then asked the AI to run similar interviews in the background with the other 2 personas.

**Ineke - Families with Children**

*Use Case:* Ineke wants to plan a family outing to urban parks, nature reserves, beaches, and public spaces in general in and around Amsterdam where people go to picnic, ride a bike, barbecue, etc. She needs to consider the interests and needs of both adults and children, ensure everyone has the necessary equipment, and be prepared for changing weather conditions.

*Key Steps in Planning Activity:*
- Decide on a suitable activity and location that everyone will enjoy.
- Check the weather forecast for the chosen day.
- Coordinate with family members to ensure everyone is available and informed.
- Plan logistics, including transportation, what to bring (snacks, drinks, gear), and any necessary equipment for children.
- Prepare backup plans in case of bad weather or other disruptions.

*Top Pain Points:*
- Weather uncertainty and last-minute changes.
- Coordinating with family members and ensuring everyone sees and responds to messages.
- Managing logistics, such as packing and preparing for children's needs.
- Coming up with backup plans that suit everyone.
- Ensuring the activity is suitable and enjoyable for children.

**Britt - Busy Professional**

*Use Case:* Britt wants to efficiently plan outdoor activities during her limited free time. She prefers quick and easy solutions that integrate weather forecasts with activity suggestions.

*Key Steps in Planning Activity:*
- Quickly check the weather forecast for the upcoming week.
- Find nearby parks or outdoor locations suitable for short breaks.
- Plan outdoor activities around her busy schedule.
- Use mobile apps or tools that provide notifications and personalized alerts.
- Ensure she has all the necessary information and gear for a quick outdoor break.

*Top Pain Points:*
- Limited time for planning and enjoying outdoor activities.
- Complicated or time-consuming planning processes.
- Lack of reliable and quick weather information.
- Finding suitable outdoor activities that fit into her busy schedule.
- Needing personalized suggestions for outdoor activities.

### Problem Statement

Ineke and Britt struggle to find the right day to organize outdoor activities, they would both like easy-to-use solutions where they plan and keep updated external people and find suitable backup plans. Both have little time to dedicate to research, planning and contacting friends or relatives. While for Ineke outdoor activities have a value related to cost and ease of access, for Britt outdoor activities are more related to mental health.

For both, weather unpredictability is the main painpoint, while ease of use and automation come in second.

### Hypotheses and Mission Statement

People in countries without consistent weather patterns often struggle with finding the right day to plan outdoor activities. They usually rely on different apps to check the weather, communicate with family and friends, organize backup plans in case of unexpected weather changes.

We are not offering a solution to the changes in weather, we're offering ease of use, and smart features to make their life simpler.

Our hypothesis is that people that value outdoor activities will find the app resolves their pain points regarding weather forecast with equal or better accuracy than competitors, and they'll get the most value through the integration of their usual journey into one single app: forecast, planning, communication, backup plans. This should reduce their pain points, reduce the time it takes to plan activities outdoors, and focus more on enjoying the activity instead of planning it.

**Our mission:** We make it easier for people to enjoy outdoor activities.

## The Solution

### Ideation

The product leverages AI capabilities to manage large quantities of historic weather data: it will initially leverage existing LLMs to analyze historic and current forecasts and propose best days for a suggested activity.

**The MVP:**
- Will only support Amsterdam.
- Will be web based.
- Will be in Dutch.
- It will be free, incorporating ads in a non-disruptive way, seamlessly integrated into the UX, potentially displaying only relevant advertisers related to outdoor activities.
- Functionality for forecast will be limited to specific dates chosen by the user, in order to reduce complexity while still offering value to users (see more in the User Journey section).
- It will include basic functionalities to add backup plans (only text field for now as placeholder for future smarter features).
- It will include the ability to invite people using emails.

### Leveraging AI

AI allows us to handle historic weather data and current forecasts, analyze it, and give us more personalized advice. This logic could be built without AI, but we choose AI for several reasons:
- It would be much harder to code the entire logic, churning the historic data for each day selected, AI can do that and calculate probabilities much faster with just a prompt.
- We need to build the internal capabilities of integrating AI into a product, and this is a low-effort way to start.

**Why do you feel AI is appropriate for the solution(s) you will be developing? Why is AI essential?**

AI is essential because it enables us to process and analyze large volumes of historical weather data combined with current forecasts to provide intelligent recommendations. The AI system will:
- Access weather data from the Royal Dutch Institute for Meteorology API (both historic and forecast data for specific dates)
- Package this data in a structured prompt for an LLM
- Request the LLM to provide "Good/Bad" advice based on the weather analysis as described in the PRD

This approach allows us to deliver personalized, data-driven recommendations that would be extremely complex and time-intensive to develop using traditional programming approaches.

### User Journeys
User logs in or creates an account.
If the user has activities planned/saved, a “home” screen is shown with the list of activities, allowing user to select and modify, or to create a new activity.
Else, user is directly sent to create a new activity.
User is given limited options on the FE to select dates.
Backend fetches forecast or historic data depending on the date selected from API:
Date > 6 days ahead: Forecast data is not available, we fetch historic data.
Date < 7 days ahead: Both forecast and historic data are available. We take only forecasts.
Data is packaged within a prompt that is sent to the LLM asking specific Good/Bad weather advice as follows:
Date > 6 days ahead: We instruct the LLM to check historic data and score the day as “Good” if 70% of the data points say so, otherwise we score it as “Bad”.
Date < 7 days ahead: We instruct the LLM to check the forecast and evaluate “Good” if 70% of the day shows dry weather. Otherwise we score it as “Bad”.
Note: The score will be tested and refined before and after roll out.
LLM receives the prompt with the supporting data, and generates Good/Bad advice.
If “Bad”, it is recommended not to proceed and asks user if they still want to go ahead. 
If user does not want to proceed, they are asked if they want to start over, in which case, they are sent back to the beginning of the flow.
If user wants to proceed, time options are served client side for user to select.
User is asked if they wish to add backup plans.
User is asked to add emails to be invited to the activity.
Invite emails are sent.
Activity is saved.
User is sent to “home” with list of existing activities and ability to create new.

### Feature Prioritization

Since this is a 0-to-1 product, the features below list those we deem essential for the MVP. We have already excluded those features we consider part of the post-launch iterations.

**Features prioritized by RICE score**
RICE score = Reach (1-100% users) x Impact (1-10) x Confidence (1-10) / Effort (1-10)

- User account setup & management: 100 x 10 x 10 / 1 = Score 10000
- Multi-lingual support (Dutch/English): 90 x 10 x 10 / 2 = Score 4500
- Mailing integration: 100 x 10 x 10 / 1 = Score 10000
- Weather data integration (API calls historic + forecast): 100 x 10 x 8 / 2 = Score 4000
- Smart activity assessment (Prompt + LLM call + Display): 100 x 10 x 8 / 2 = Score 4000
- Activity creation & management (including date selection): 100 x 10 x 10 / 1 = Score 10000
- Backup plan creation & management: 70 x 8 x 10 / 1 = Score 4000
- Invite creation & management: 80 x 10 x 10 / 1 = Score 8000
- Monitoring tools: 100 x 10 x 8 / 1 = Score 8000

### AI MVP

We won't be creating an AI/Model MVP, we will leverage an existing LLM, and prompt it including data from a weather API to provide simple advice to users:
- We query an API with structured data about historic and forecast weather, and feed relevant sections with the prompt to the LLM.
- We ask in the prompt to the LLM to interpret the data and provide a simple "Good/Bad" weather advice based on historic + current forecast data.

### Functional Requirements

User Account Management: Users can register, log in, and securely manage their profiles.
Activity Creation & Management: Users can create new activities, view/edit scheduled ones. Past activities are filtered out and a filter is shown to access them. Each activity has a tag/status: Draft, Future, Past. Draft are those left unfinished (workflow not finalized, saved temporary and automatically during the flow). Past are accessible through filters in the Home and are read only. Future activities are fully editable until their starting hour.  All activities can be deleted, those Future would trigger emails to invitees.
Multi-lingual Support: Basic architecture, we will only provide Dutch for the MVP but we need to create the architecture to offer it in the post-launch iterations.
Date Selection: Users select dates for activities via the interface.
Automated Weather Data Integration: System fetches relevant forecast and historical weather data based on user-selected date.
Intelligent Activity Assessment: Backend packages weather and activity data, sends to AI model (LLM). Prompt should include evaluation system based on a score the LLM can use to classify days into Good/Bad as follows: Date > 6 days ahead: Forecast data is not available, we use historic data and score the day as “Good” if 70% of the data points say so, otherwise we score it as “Bad”. Date < 7 days ahead: We take only forecasts and evaluate “Good” if 70% of the day shows dry weather. Otherwise we score it as “Bad”. Note: The score will be tested and refined before and after roll out.
Advice Display & Decision Flow: Users receive activity advice (Good/Bad). If Bad, system asks if the user wishes to proceed.
Backup Plan Creation & Management: Users can add backup plans and edit them in the context of an existing activity editing scenario.
Invitation Management: Users specify invitees. System creates and sends email invites.
Activity Saving & History: System saves new activities and updates future ones as managed by the user. Keeps track of activity status/history.
Back to Home Logic: Once an activity is cancelled, or deleted, or saved, users are offered a confirmation page and sent back to the Home.
Destructive actions require double confirmation. Save is performed automatically along the flow and saved as “in progress”.

### Non-functional Requirements 

Security: Authentication, privacy, GDPR compliance
Scalability: Can grow with user/activity numbers
Performance: Fast, responsive, optimized for load
Usability: Intuitive, accessible, user-friendly interface
Reliability: High uptime, backups, graceful failures
Maintainability: Modular, documented, automated tests
Availability: 24/7 access
Compliance: Logging, data export, audit readiness
Monitoring: System health and user activity analytics
Evals: Human data analysis of advice traces, LLM judges for scalability

### AI & Data Requirements
Since we will only leverage existing LLMs, we do not need specific data requirements.
We do need to make sure the prompt packaging the API-retrieved data delivers on the expected advice, and make sure the integration with the LLM is reliable. 
We will evaluate accuracy of response manually in the MVP and then incorporate a specific metric (see Measuring Success).


### Challenges
Since we do not create our own AI/Model, the only concerns we have are:
Finding enough advertisement to cover the costs during the first months, while we validate the hypothesis.
The reliability of the free data we will fetch through the API from the Royal Dutch Institute of Meteorology (KNMI), which offers forecasts only for the coming 6 days.
Nailing the prompt that will read the data and score the day as Good/Bad, without turning users away.


### Positioning

**General Considerations**
Even though in users’ minds this app might be closer to communication and productivity tools such as agendas, calendars and emails, we decided to market SunnyDays closer to weather app space because that’s usually where the user flow starts, and because weather unpredictability is the main pain point users have.

Unlike weather apps, SunnyDays allows users to plan outdoor activities, include backup plans, and invite other people. Unlike traditional calendars, SunnyDays focuses on outdoor activities.

**Value Proposition**
We offer an easier and faster way for people to plan activities outdoors with family and friends.

**Brand Promise**
Sunny days with less stress.

**Who is It for?**
For people of all ages and ways of life interested in planning outdoor activities.
The MVP will focus on Families and Busy Professional user segments in the Netherlands.

**Main Alternatives**
Weather apps + Messaging apps + Calendar apps.

**Market Opportunity**
There is a market gap, a niche that is not covered in countries with less sunny days and more unpredictable weather.

**Key Differentiators**
Integrating features and functionalities that are usually scattered into a seamless user experience, with addition of smart recommendations.

Use Case: Outdoor activity planning
Pain Point: Weather unpredictability and manual search for weather conditions
Possible Solutions: Leveraging existing data + smart analysis and advice from LLMs
Impact of Solution: Improved suggestion for specific dates, leveraging historic data for better predictability, elimination of manual weather search 

Use Case: Backup plans
Pain Point: Considering, researching and communicating possible indoor activities
Possible Solutions: Include backup plan in the flow, communicate plans to invitees within the same flow
Impact of Solution: Improved planning, reduces frustration because included in one flow from the start, reduced management time via inclusion in invite.

Use Case: Communicating and updating invitees
Pain Point: Managing the communication through separate platform(s) and possibility to miss people
Possible Solutions: Include invite in the same workflow, send invites and updates automatically
Impact of Solution: Reduced friction in communication, reduced planning time, reduced possibilities of missing people.



### Measuring Success

**Product Metrics**
Daily New Registrations
Daily Active Users
Daily Activities Created
Daily Invites Sent
Future Metrics: 
App Downloads (when mobile apps are created and published)
Weather Data Accuracy Validation (we will select a number of activities randomly and evaluate match between advice and actual weather, requiring an extra API call for each activity evaluated on the day of the activity)
Technical Metrics
System Uptime
Error Rate
Average Page Load/Response Time

**AI-specific Metrics**
Since we do not have a proprietary model, nor we tweak an existing, the most important metrics to consider in this section are:
LLM Response Latency
LLM Advise Accuracy

**North Star Metric**
Our North Star Metric is the “Daily Activities Created” because it gives us a three-fold insight:
Actual usage of the most crucial part of the flow.
A proxy on the trust users put in the advice.
A direct expression of user engagement.

### Roadmap

**General notes**
We want to develop and learn fast, so we plan weekly sprints with small incremental steps on each of them.
Feature focus is driven by RICE prioritization in the PRD: Invitations, monitoring, weather/LLM flow - all high score.
All core and smart functionalities (account, activities, weather, LLM, invites) in first 5–6 weeks.
Non-functional requirements like monitoring, reliability, and security implemented gradually, with checks before Beta.
We will first create a PoC that we will use internally and expose it to a few selected users for qualitative feedback; we then plan a Beta with limited release; and finally the Full rollout once performance/quality is validated.


### Launching

**Stakeholders & Communication**
The team is small and compact, so there is no need to have a process in place beyond the every day running of the team.
Main external stakeholders are investors, which we will keep up to date in regular meetings.
Users will get notified of any important news via email and later on, using mobile app notifications.
